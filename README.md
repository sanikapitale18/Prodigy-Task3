# 📊 Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Dataset

## 📌 Internship
**Prodigy Infotech – Data Science Internship**

## 📌 Task Objective
The objective of this task is to build a **Decision Tree Classification model** that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on their **demographic and behavioral attributes**.

This task demonstrates the application of **machine learning classification techniques** on a real-world dataset and focuses on data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation.
